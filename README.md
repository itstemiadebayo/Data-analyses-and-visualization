# Data Analysis and Visualization
A personal project to improve my data analysis skills in R using dataset from [#tidytuesday data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). Some of these projects were created while watching David Robinson screencast on YouTube and others were inspired by data analyst on twitter.
